## Description
  Multiple generations of TP-Link Deco mesh router systems. Need to inventory which models and how many units per set.

  **Models Available:** [List specific models - X65, X20, M5, etc.]
  **Pack Sizes:** [2-pack, 3-pack, etc.]
  **Condition:** [Specify condition per set]
  **Includes:** [Power adapters, ethernet cables, original packaging if available]

  ## Where to Sell
  **Facebook Marketplace** - Excellent for tech gear, strong demand for mesh routers

  **Alternative:** Craigslist, OfferUp

  **Consider:** eBay for higher-end models (X65 especially)

  ## Shipping
  **Shipping OK** - Lightweight and easy to pack. Can ship USPS Priority for $10-20 per set depending on pack size.

  ## Notes
  - Photo each set separately showing: All units, power adapters, any packaging
  - Inventory what you have:
    - X65 (Wi-Fi 6, premium model) - $150-200/3-pack
    - X20 (Wi-Fi 6, mid-range) - $80-120/3-pack
    - M5 (older Wi-Fi 5) - $50-80/3-pack
  - Test each set - ensure they power on and broadcast WiFi
  - Factory reset before selling
  - Include all power adapters (critical - these are proprietary)
  - Mesh routers sell very well - easy setup appeals to non-tech people
  - Consider bundling smaller sets or selling individually if someone only needs 1-2 units
