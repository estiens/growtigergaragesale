  ## Description
  Bachetta Giro recumbent bicycle in decent condition. Not ridden in 15 years but Bachetta is a quality brand in the recumbent world.

  **Condition:** Good but needs maintenance
  **Brand:** Bachetta (respected recumbent manufacturer)
  **Needs:** New tires, tubes, chain - basic refresh
  **Frame:** [Specify size/color]

  ## Where to Sell
  **Facebook Marketplace** - Cycling community

  **Better Options:**
  - **RecumbentRiders.org** classifieds - Dedicated recumbent community
  - **BentRider Online** forums
  - Local bike co-ops or bike shops (consignment)

  **Alternative:** Craigslist cycling section

  ## Shipping
  **LOCAL PICKUP ONLY** - Recumbent bikes are large, awkward to ship, and expensive to pack.

  ## Notes
  ⚠️ **REFURB REQUIRED:** Budget $100-150 for new tires, tubes, chain, basic tune-up before selling. Price reflects this investment.

  - Photos showing: Overall bike, seat, handlebars, current tire/chain condition, frame details
  - Bachetta is premium brand - don't underprice even with needed maintenance
  - Be honest in listing about needed work OR do the work first
  - Two selling strategies:
    1. Sell as-is for $200-300 ("needs basic maintenance")
    2. Invest $100-150 in refresh, sell for $400-500
  - Recumbent market is niche but passionate - right buyer will drive for this
  - Mention frame size and rider height compatibility
  - 15 years unused means everything rubber needs replacing (tires, brake pads, possibly cables)
  - Could also donate to bike co-op for tax deduction if hassle not worth it
