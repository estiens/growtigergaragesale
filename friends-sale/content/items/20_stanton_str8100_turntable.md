  ⚠️ **TEST FIRST:** Unknown working condition is major factor. Price assumes it works.

  - Photos showing: Overall unit, platter, tonearm, controls, connections, any cosmetic issues
  - Test before listing:
    - Does motor turn on and spin platter?
    - Does it hold steady speed (33/45 RPM)?
    - Does tonearm move freely?
    - Any audio output?
  - STR8-100 was Stanton's entry into DJ turntable market (competing with Technics)
  - 1996 makes this ~30 years old - vintage appeal for collectors
  - Two scenarios:
    1. **Works:** $150-200 to DJ/collector
    2. **Doesn't work / parts only:** $50-75 for parts/project
  - Be honest in listing if untested/as-is
  - Include any cartridge or stylus currently installed
  - Stanton is respected brand but not Technics 1200 level
