## Platform Strategy

### Facebook Marketplace (Most Items)
Primary platform for:
- Kitchen appliances (KitchenAid, Vitamix, DeLonghi)
- Home goods (AC, Cricut, SodaStream)
- Sonos speakers (all of them)
- TP-Link mesh routers
- E-bike batteries (also try specialty forums)

**Pros:** Free, local, no shipping headaches, quick sales
**Cons:** Tire-kickers, lowballers, flakes

### Reverb.com (Music Gear Only)
**Use for:**
- Boss RC-505 Loop Station
- Looptimus MIDI Pedal
- Ableton Push 2
- Boss DR-202 Drum Machine
- Pro-Ject Turntable
- Stanton turntable (if working)

**Cons:** 5% commission
**Verdict:** Worth it for music gear - saves hassle and gets better prices

### ExpressoBeans.com (Concert Posters)
**Use for:**
- Phish Baker's Dozen poster
- Phish Curveball poster

**Pros:** THE marketplace for concert posters, Phish collectors specifically
**Cons:** ~10% commission
**Verdict:** Only place to get fair value for Phish prints

### Specialty Forums & Communities
**E-bike parts:**
- EndlessSphere.com (hub motors)
- ElectricBikeReview.com (batteries)
- Rad Power Facebook groups

**Recumbent bike:**
- RecumbentRiders.org
- BentRider Online

**Vintage audio:**
- Vinyl Engine (turntables)
- AudioKarma (vintage gear)

## Effort vs. Value Analysis

### Not Worth The Hassle
- Grizzly hub motors ($200-400) - pain to remove
- Maybe keep with bike as project/parts

### Requires Work First
- Bachetta bike - needs $100-150 refurb or sell as-is for less
- Stanton turntable - test before listing
- DeLonghi - identify model (critical for pricing)

### Decision Required
- **Sonos Five** - "debate this one" per notes. Keep or sell?
- **Phish posters** - emotional value vs. $600-800 cash
- **Cricut supplies** - bundle or separate?

## Shipping Considerations

### Easy To Ship
✅ All Sonos speakers (compact, not too heavy)
✅ E-bike batteries (ground shipping only, label properly)
✅ Music gear (controllers, pedals, small machines)
✅ TP-Link routers (lightweight)
✅ Posters (pack carefully, insure)

### Local Pickup Only
❌ LG AC unit (60-100 lbs)
❌ Bachetta recumbent bike (large, awkward)

### Pickup Strongly Preferred
⚠️ KitchenAid mixer (heavy, can ship if needed)
⚠️ Vitamix (heavy, glass container fragile)
⚠️ Turntables (fragile, annoying to pack)
⚠️ Cricut + supplies (bulky, heavy combined)
⚠️ SodaStream (CO2 canisters can't ship)

## Action Plan

### Week 1: Easy Money
1. List all Sonos gear (Beam Gen 2, Sub Mini, Beam Gen 1, One SL)
2. List e-bike batteries on FB Marketplace + specialty forums
3. List LG AC (seasonal urgency)
4. List music production gear on Reverb (Push 2, RC-505)

### Week 2: Kitchen & Home
1. Identify KitchenAid and Vitamix models
2. Clean and photograph both
3. List on FB Marketplace
4. Test and list SodaStream

### Week 3: Specialty Items
1. Test Stanton turntable, identify DeLonghi model
2. Photograph Phish posters (if selling)
3. List posters on ExpressoBeans
4. List vintage music gear on Reverb

### Week 4: Decision Time
1. Decide on Sonos Five (keep or sell?)
2. Decide on Grizzly motors (remove or skip?)
3. Decide on Bachetta bike (refurb or as-is?)
4. Evaluate what's left and adjust pricing
