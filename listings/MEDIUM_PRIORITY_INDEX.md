## Decision Points

### Should You Sell?
**Sonos Five** - CSV notes "debate this one." Beautiful for music but Era 100s + Sub might be enough. Five holds value well if you change your mind later.

**Phish Posters** - Both have significant personal/emotional value (especially Curveball with NOLA story). Consider carefully before selling.

### Effort vs. Value
**Grizzly Hub Motors** - $200-400 but "pain to remove." Worth your time?

**Bachetta Bike** - Invest $100-150 in refurb to sell for $400-500? Or sell as-is for $200-300?

**Stanton Turntable** - Untested/unknown working condition. Test first to establish value.

**DeLonghi** - Identify exact model before listing - makes or breaks the sale.

## Specialized Platforms Worth Using

  - THE marketplace for music gear - worth the commission
