## Priority Actions

### Immediate (Do First)
1. **Identify exact models** for items with [brackets] - critical for pricing
2. **Test all electronic items** - ensure they work before listing
3. **Take photos** of everything - you mentioned you'll add actual pics
4. **Inventory TP-Link routers** - need to know which models and quantities

### Quick Wins (Should Sell Fast)
- E-bike batteries (huge demand, never used Rad Power battery)
- Sonos gear (strong brand, holds value)
- Vitamix & KitchenAid (kitchen staples)
- LG AC (seasonal demand - list ASAP before summer ends)

### Specialized Platforms to Consider
- **Reverb.com** for Boss RC-505 and Ableton Push 2 (music gear marketplace)
- **eBay** might be worth it for high-value e-bike batteries (larger audience)
- **Facebook Groups** for Rad Power and Ariel Rider owners (targeted buyers)
